This is a test program for the cooperation between python multiprocessing
and f2py. 

Compilation with 

f2py -c -m sine_module sine_operation.f

sine_module.sine_add_1 works nicely, but the use of shared data is pointless...
sine_module.sine_add_2 does not work, there is something I don't understand...
